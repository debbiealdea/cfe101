            <p>This course has thought me the Life of our God, at first we are ask about What is the meaning of the word Faith to you? Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen. In My understanding of  the word  Faith, is being loyal to someone you have not seen nor talk to in your lifetime or Someone that you can trust even if you are not together like your closest friend, you have faith in her/him that he/she will not backstab you or do some things that he/she knows that will hurt you.
            </p>

               <h2>FAITH</h2>
               <p>Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen. In My understanding of  the word  Faith, is being loyal to someone you have not seen nor talk to in your lifetime or Someone that you can trust even if you are not together like your closest friend, you have faith in her/him that he/she will not backstab you or do some things that he/she knows that will hurt you.</p>
               <h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF FAITH</h2>
               <p>The Absolute<br>

                Trinitarian<br>
                
                Loving, Maturing and Missionary<br>
                
                Informed and Communitarian<br>

                        <h2>1. TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE</h2>
                        <p>In The Module Only Faith in God calls for a total and absolute adherence. Christ himself provides, especially in his passion, Death and Resurrection. The Total and absolute for me is that being Faithful is that all things are possible in Gods sovereign power. Absolute Faith is something you know that you will have faith to and it will never change. Like a person who believe in Gods love is an absolute.. </p>
                        <h2>2. TRINITARIAN</h2>
                        <p>The Paraphrase "In the name of The Father, Into The Son and to The Holy Spirit" The Trinity represents God The Father, Jesus Christ  the Son and The Holy Spirit. God exists as three persons but as one is person is fully a God, There is only One God. Pope Francis says that we are the "Divine Family" is us we are Gods Family and we should live with love because when there is love, there is God.  </p>
                   
                        <h2>3. LOVING, MATURING AND MISSIONARY</h2>
                        <p>In The Module Only Faith in God calls for a total and absolute adherence. Christ himself provides, especially in his passion, Death and Resurrection. The Total and absolute for me is that being Faithful is that all things are possible in Gods sovereign power. Absolute Faith is something you know that you will have faith to and it will never change. Like a person who believe in Gods love is an absolute.. </p>
                    
                        <h2>4. INFORMED AND COMMUNITARIAN</h2>
                        <p> You must deepen your understanding of and affection for because of the dynamic character of faith. Jesus. What does it imply when St. Anselm says "faith wants understanding"?
                            is for you to not supplant faith with knowledge, but rather to have "an active love of God pursuing a
                            deeper insight of God But a more profound understanding of God occurs internally.
                            the Church, which is composed of Christians. </p>
                 
                        <h2>5. INCULTURATED</h2>
                        <p>The practice of your faith is manifested in your daily life and relationships. It takes 
                            into consideration the community where you belong. </p>

                    <p> In the course cfe it is more than the word faith that you will learn like that we should all be united and to no discriminate each other. Just because they are not like you doesn't mean that they
                        can't do the things that you can.
                        Knowing that God is always merciful to us and loving, i will have faith on him at all times, thank him to what he gives me that I am not deserving of, In every wrong choice I make he will save and guide me to a better person.</p>

                    <p>The story poster is telling us to have faith in our 
                        God. Most of the time we have faith on 
                        him but never that strong. 
                        Pray to our God at all times because He 
                        knows the answers to anything, he will 
                        provide us everything we need. We may 
                        be all sinners but we are still a child of 
                        God. For example when you are feeling 
                        down because your path right now didn’t 
                        reach your expectations, but know that 
                        God has a better plan for you, just have 
                        faith on him and always pray.</p>

                As I journeyed with God by my side, i dedicated A poem from all my my experiences and realizations in life.
                
                Oh Our Dear God how good you are indeed, The people always turn there back on you and leave, But you always forgive. Oh Dear God you gave us life that we never asked for, You made us learn to believe in ourselves in all ways, and to have faith in you in our dark days.
           <br>As i Journey with God I realized that not understanding others specially on your Family and Closest friends is one of the actions to be a Covenant with God. The course always reminds us that not to be kind to everyone because Kindness is one of Our Gods aspects.

            <p> The course Cfe 101 is a great inspiration for me, it's not just like one of the subjects that makes you go on with your life and be an adult rather it made you believe in faith. I'm a college student I know how it fells when your exam week is coming, you always feel pressured, stressed, depressed and you always think that you can't make it. But Pray in God, Have faith in him and believe in yourself because you are a child of God, You will pass and graduate. The answers of your prayers might not appear to you physically but it can be mentally and spiritually.</p>
